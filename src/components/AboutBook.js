      <p >
        I was in Bangalore for a few months during a weird phase in my life. I
        met several people, for different reasons. This book is a short fiction
        sitcom-kind-of novel trying to explore all the kinds of people I have
        met then and all the places that I have been to, in Bangalore. I have
        tried to reflect my experiences by weaving around a fictional tale
        around a few people in their twenties, living in Bangalore. This is my
        first book. There could be mistakes but I tried to make it a good read.
        If you’ve liked it, reach me out and let me know. If you’ve complaints,
        we must definitely talk.
